#summary Continuing development of EveDb

= Current state =

EveDb has very limited amount of methods, only those I initially needed for my calculations and information lookup. Hopefully, it will be gradually expanded if such need will arise.

= Known issues =

== Cold start ==

Application cold start takes about 4-5 seconds. This can be improved by using `@LazySingleton` in Guice. Probably other technologies, for instance Python has much better cold start times. Optimization that already been done and considerably reduced cold start time:
  * [http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/datastore/usingjdo.html JDO] replaced with [http://code.google.com/p/objectify-appengine/ Objectify]
  * [http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.0.x/reference/beans.html Spring] replaced with [http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/ Guice]
  * [https://jersey.dev.java.net/ Jersey] replaces with [http://www.restlet.org/ Restlet], and then switched to plain Servlets

== Lookup queries ==

Datastore does not support SQL-like LIKE queries. Yeah, just like that. Do not expect that `lookupType/orax` would return you `Thorax`. There is a trick how to make LIKE-queries on Datastore, but they are limited:
  * matching only from begining
  * case-sensitive
