== Creating dataset from static database dump ==

You will need EVE Online static database dump to create dataset. There is [http://www.eveonline.com/community/toolkit.asp official one], but it is MSSQL. There is MySQL conversion from [http://wiki.eve-id.net/CCP_Database_Dump_Resources EVEDev].

Run SQL queries `database/data/*.sql` and store result in corresponding CSV files. E.g. for file `invTypes.sql` there should be `invTypes.csv`.

== Uploading data ==

You will need [http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html AppEngine SDK] (both Java and Python). Get familiar with [http://code.google.com/appengine/ AppEngine docs] and manage to create AppEngine application. Edit `database/python/app.yaml` to set your application id. Run `database/load-*.bat` scripts to load CSV data into Datastore.
