#summary Using EveDb: existing or own instance
#labels Featured

= Getting Started =

== Using existing instance ==

If you do not want to create your own AppEngine application, load data into it and deploy, than you can use already existing and running one at [http://odylab-evedb.appspot.com/version http://odylab-evedb.appspot.com]. I maintain couple of dump versions, so, feel free to use it. Just go to page with available [Methods Methods] and see what you can do.

== Creating own instance ==

If you want your own AppEngine application with running EveDb, you will have to create data set using static database dump, upload it into Datastore and deploy Java application into AppEngine.

=== Load data into Datastore ===

==== Static database dump ====

You will need EVE Online static database dump to create dataset that will be loaded into Datastore. I used MySQL variant from [http://wiki.eve-id.net/CCP_Database_Dump_Resources EVEDev].

==== Create CSV files with data ====

Run SQL queries `database/data/*.sql` and store result in corresponding CSV file. E.g. for file `invTypes.sql` you should have `invTypes.csv`.

==== Upload data into Datastore ====

You will need [http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html AppEngine SDK] (both Java and Python). I will assume that you read [http://code.google.com/appengine/ AppEngine docs] and managed to create application. Edit `database/python/app.yaml` to set your application id. Run `database/python/*Loader.py` scripts to load CSV data into Datastore.

=== Deploy application ===

Build application with `mvn-clean-package.bat` or `mvn clean package`, deploy with `ws/appcfg-update.bat` or `appcfg update target/evedb-ws-<VERSION>`.
