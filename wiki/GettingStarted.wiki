= Getting Started =

== Easy way ==

If you do not want to create your own AppEngine application, load data into it, deploy application, than you can use already existing and running one at [http://odylab-evedb.appspot.com/version http://odylab-evedb.appspot.com]. I maintain couple of dump versions, so, feel free to use it. Just go to page with available [Methods methods].

== Hard way ==

If you are interested in implementation details or want your own AppEngine application with running EveDb, than this chapter is for you.

== Known issues ==

=== Cold start time ===
Google AppEngine stops application if it is not used by anyone for certain amount of time, like 10 minutes, or so. If requests comes when application is stopped, it gets started, so called "cold start" because it takes longer time. Current EveDb cold start time is about 5 seconds. Which is quite high. This is something that will be improved. _Python has much better cold start times._

=== Lookup queries ===
Datastore does not support LIKE operations. Yeah, just like that. So, do not expect that `lookupType/orax` would return you `Thorax`. There is a trick how to make LIKE-queries on Datastore, but they are limited. TBD.

=== Schema migration ===
TBD
